# Data Structures & Algorithms in Python (Udacity Course)

These are my notes + reflection from the Udacity course, [Data Structures & Algorithms in Python](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-python--ud513)

This was one of the free courses recommended in the original Coding Interview University curriculum, and I do like free. And although my focus is JavaScript, I am interested in learning Python. I also thought that thinking about the implementation of these concepts in JavaScript was a good thought exercise and practice for interviews.

If you can implement the data structure/algorithm in a language, you can explain it during an interview.

Or something like that.

## Lesson 1: Efficiency


## Reflections

As I'm finishing up Lesson 2, I'm feeling like these concepts are easy to grasp. Maybe because now I've been exposed to much more information about computer science and programming and gained more knowledge about them.

But I remember in college I felt like I was too behind to understand them. I wish I'd been told more often that a lot of people start out not knowing any CS when they take the intro to CS classes. But it always felt like everyone around me was coasting through those classes.
