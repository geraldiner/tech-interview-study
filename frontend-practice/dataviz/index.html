  -- Display histogram
  [] x-axis start at one corner and extends to the right
  --- interval might be by 1 bc of the randomness in the numbers
  --- spacing between bars is margin
  [] y-axis start at the same corner and extends upward
  --- calculate interval based on the range of the numbers? or the average difference between numbers?
  --- 24 ones -> 17 twos => 7
  --- 17 twos -> 30 threes => 13 
  [] display bars
  --- number of bars comes from the number of numbers that are seen
  --- height of bars comes from the frequency- might need a factor (like 2x the actual frequency) to get a good sized histogram
  --- uniform thickness
